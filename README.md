# Latex playbook
A LaTeX project to create nice looking theater playbooks, as used by the german ensemble [Der ChaosTRUB](http://chaostrub.de)

# Installation
In order to use this project, you must install and use [LuaLaTeX](http://www.luatex.org). This is necessary in order to import fonts without too much effort. To create the PDF, run
